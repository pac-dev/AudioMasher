<li>Table <em>seq</em> is the sequence for the warm saw sound. </li>
<li>Table <em>prog</em> is used together with <em>seq</em> to build a "progression"</li>
<li>Table <em>seq2</em> is used to sequence the warm fm sound. </li>
<li>Variable <em>clk</em> is used to store the clock signal</li>
<li>Variable <em>send</em> is used as a send signal for the delay. </li>
<li>Variable <em>env</em> is used to store an envelope signal</li>

<h2>The Clock</h2>
<p>First, the clock signal is created. The clock is generated using 
<strong>dmetro</strong>. It is set to 125 BPM, then multiplied by 4 to get 
sixteenth note subdivisions. The clock is sent into a maytrig
with an 80% probability rate. All of this is assigned to 
the variable <em>clk</em>.</p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> 125 4 * bpm2dur dmetro 0.8 maytrig _clk set </code></pre>
<h2>Warm Saw Sound</h2>
<p>The warm sound saw is a sequenced subtractive sawtooth patch. 
The sequence is created via <strong>tseq</strong>, using the values inside of <em>seq</em>,
and the clock <em>clk</em>. </p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> _clk get 0 _seq tseq 58 + </code></pre>
<p>To add a sense of a chord progression, another "progression" sequence
is added to the note as a bias. The same <em>clk</em> signal is used, but it
is fed into clock divider <strong>tdiv</strong> so that the "chord" changes every 
4 notes. To keep it from changing that frequently, the clock signal is
fed into a <strong>maytrig</strong>. </p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> _clk get 4 0 tdiv 0.1 maytrig 1 _prog tseq + </code></pre>
<p>To add occasional octave leaps, <strong>maygate</strong> scaled by 12 is added into
the sequence signal. </p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> 12 _clk get 0.2 maygate * + </code></pre>
<p>To simulate analogue "drift", <strong>jitter</strong> is added to the sequenced signal.
This entire signal is converted to frequency via <strong>mtof</strong>. </p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> 0.1 0.1 5 jitter + mtof </code></pre>
<p>Portamento between frequencies is controlled via <strong>port</strong>. The portamento
time is randomized via <strong>randi</strong> to pick a value between 1 and 20 milliseconds
every 5 seconds (<strong>inv</strong> efficiently inverts a number). </p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> 0.001 0.02 (5 inv) randi port </code></pre>
<p>With the frequency set, the amplitude of the saw is set to 0.4. </p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> 0.4 saw </code></pre>
<p>The sawtooth signal is fed into butterworth lowpass filter <strong>butlp</strong>.
The cutoff frequency of the filter is determined via a sinusoidal LFO
<strong>sine</strong>, modulating between 200 and 800 Hz. </p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> 15 inv 1 sine 200 800 biscale butlp</code></pre>
<p>The amplitude of the filtered saw signal is modulated by envelope 
generator <strong>tenv</strong>. The envelope used is very long, and is meant to
be the contour for many notes at a given time. Since the clock signal
is way too fast for this, it is sent through <strong>maytrig</strong>. </p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> _clk get 0.05 maytrig  1.4 1.1 2.3 tenv *</code></pre>
<h2>Streson Prickles</h2>
<p>Now for the instrument I like to call "streson prickles". These are the
most novel sounds of the patch, created using a series of string resonators.
The start of this sound are short little noise bursts, created from 
<em>clk</em>, <strong>maytrig</strong>, <strong>tenvx</strong>, and <strong>noise</strong>.</p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> _clk get 0.7 maytrig 0.001 0.001 0.001 tenvx 1.9 noise * </code></pre>
<p><strong>Streson</strong>, is a string resonator. When fed an impulse (like from the noise 
bursts ) it will produce a karplus strong pluck sound. In addition to the
input signal, there are two arguments to <strong>streson</strong>: the filter frequency 
determines the frequency of the string, and the feedback amount determines
how long the note stays on for. The first string resonator has both 
the frequency and feedback parameters being randomized by <em>clk</em>-synchronized
random number generators <strong>trand</strong>. </p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> _clk get 100 1000 trand _clk get 0.8 0.9 trand streson </code></pre>
<p>This signal is fed through two other string resonators in series. 
The decay times are set to be constants at 0.9, and 0.8, respectively.</p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> _clk get 400 4000 trand 0.9 streson 
 _clk get 100 1000 trand 0.8 streson  </code></pre>
<p>To keep samples numerically reasonable, this signal is fed through a 
DC blocker <strong>dcblk</strong> and attenuated by 10 dB. Some of the high end is 
shaved off using a lowpass filter <strong>butlp</strong>.</p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> dcblk -10 ampdb * 2500 butlp </code></pre>
<p>This sound is complete, but copy of it is sent to the variable <em>send</em>
to be used as a throw signal. The throw mechanism below is built out
of a <strong>maygate</strong>, <strong>tdiv</strong>, and <strong>port</strong> filter. </p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> dup _clk get 4 0 tdiv 0.1 maygate 0.01 port * _send set +</code></pre>
<h2>Pinging FM Sound</h2>
<p>The final instrument in the mix is a pinging FM sound. It is a sound
buried in the mix. As the trigger signal will show, it is very sparse,
having <strong>clk</strong> being set through a very large clock divider and 
<strong>maytrig</strong>.</p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> _clk get 16 0 tdiv 0.5 maytrig </code></pre>
<p>A copy of the signal maytrig is made with <strong>dup</strong>, and it is fed into
the envelope generator <strong>tenvx</strong>. This generator sets the envelope <em>env</em>.</p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> dup 0.005 0.01 0.3 tenvx _env set</code></pre>
<p>The clock signal that was <strong>dup</strong>d before feeds into a <strong>tseq</strong>, where it
is then biased by 58. When I wrote this patch, I wanted to bump this synth
up an octave, so I added 12 to it too. </p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> 1 _seq2 tseq 58 12 + + mtof </code></pre>
<p>The amplitude of the FM synth is is modulated by a slow moving LFO.</p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> 13 inv 1 sine 0.01 0.2 biscale </code></pre>
<p>The C:M ratio is set to a typically very bright 2:5. </p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> 2 5 </code></pre>
<p>The modulation index is modulated by envelope stored in <em>env</em>. This 
basically controls "brightness" in the FM world. This is the final argument
in <strong>fm</strong>, the sound generator.</p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> _env get 5 * fm </code></pre>
<p>In addition to manipulating the timbre, <em>env</em> also controls the amplitude.
this signal is then fed into <strong>butlp</strong>. </p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> _env get * 1500 butlp </code></pre>
<p>The instrument signal generated is copied and added onto the <em>send</em> signal,
which will be sent into some effects. </p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> dup 0.3 * _send get + _send set +</code></pre>
<h2>Effects</h2>
<p>The first effect used in this patch is a feedback delay, with a very
large feedback parameter. The delay time is based on the BPM, and is set
to approximately dotted quarters. I say "approximately" because I made it
slightly longer to make it go out of phase with the dry signal. </p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> dup 0.9 125 bpm2dur 1.51 * delay 2000 butlp -8 ampdb * + </code></pre>
<p>Next, the <em>send</em> signals are processed. First, <em>send</em> is fed into 
<strong>revsc</strong>. It is fed into a dc blocker <strong>dcblk</strong>, and a high pass filter
<strong>buthp</strong>. </p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> _send get dup 0.98 5550 revsc drop 0.9 * dcblk 200 buthp + </code></pre>
<p>The <em>send</em> signal is fed into a tempo-synced feedback delay line 
<strong>delay</strong>. It is attenuated and then added into the rest of the patch.</p>
<pre class=dont_try><code> _send get 0.3 125 bpm2dur delay -3 ampdb * +

</code></pre>
